## Key Features

### üìÇ File Handling
* **Load Files**: Open `.wfm` files via the "Load" button or by **dragging and dropping** them onto the page.
* **Multi-File Support**: Load multiple files simultaneously, each managed in a separate **tab**.
* **File Information**: The sidebar displays the current filename and total number of data points.

***

### üìà Waveform Display & Interaction
* **Modern Chart Interaction (TradingView Style)**:
    * **Pan**: Click and drag on the chart to pan freely in any direction (up, down, left, and right).
    * **Axis-Specific Zoom**: Hover your mouse over the time (bottom) or voltage (left/right) axes and use the **Mouse Wheel** to zoom that axis independently.
    * **Area Zoom**: Press the `Z` key to activate zoom mode for one use. Then, click and drag to select and zoom into a specific region.
* **View Controls**:
    * **Fit & Reset View**: A two-stage system for quickly adjusting the view.
        * Press `F` (1st press) to **Fit Y-Axis** to the data currently in view.
        * Press `F` (2nd press) or **Double-Click** the plot to perform a **Full Reset** (fits all data).
    * **Snap to Scales**: Optionally snap zoom levels to standard oscilloscope time/voltage scales.
    * **Relative Time**: Set the start of the current view as $t=0$ for relative measurements.
* **Channel Management**:
    * Toggle channel visibility.
    * Swap the drawing order (bring a channel to the front).
    * Assign custom names and legends to each channel.

### üìè Measurements & Analysis
* **Live Measurement Table**: An on-screen table displays key statistics for the *visible* portion of the waveform.
    * **Available Calculations**: **Max**, **Min**, **Average**, and **RMS** voltage.
    * **Customizable**: Toggle which measurements are displayed.
* **Cursor Measurements**:
    * Enable two horizontal and two vertical cursors for precise readouts.
    * Measures **$\Delta V$** (voltage difference), **$\Delta t$** (time difference), and frequency ($1/\Delta t$).
    * **Channel Tracking**: Cursors can "snap" to a selected channel's waveform.
    * **Quick Set**: Instantly move cursors to the max/min voltage points in the current view.

***

### ‚úíÔ∏è Annotations
* **Area Annotation**: Hold `Shift` + `Drag` to draw a persistent measurement box showing the region's $\Delta t$ and $\Delta V$.
* **Text Annotation**: Press `T` to enter text mode and click on the plot to add labels.
* **Manage Annotations**: Select annotations to move or resize them. Press `Delete` to remove a selected annotation.

***

### üì§ Exporting & Copying
* **Quick Copy**: Press `Ctrl` + `C` to copy the current view to the clipboard as a PNG image. A **"B&W Copy"** theme is available for high-contrast pastes.
* **Advanced Export Dialog**: Generate professional-grade output for reports or data processing.
    * **Formats**: **PNG**, **SVG** (vector), and **CSV** (raw data).
    * **Data Scope**: Export either the current zoomed-in view or the entire waveform dataset.
    * **Styling Options**:
        * **Black & White**: Creates a high-contrast, printer-friendly version.
        * **IEEE Style**: Formats the plot for academic publications (specific size, `10pt Times New Roman` font, simplified colors).
        * **Measurements Below Plot**: Option to place the measurement table neatly at the bottom.

## How to Use

1.  **Download**: Save the `index.html` file from this repository to your computer.
2.  **Open**: Open the file in a modern web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
3.  **Load**: Drag a `.wfm` file onto the page or use the "Load WFM File" button.

***

## Compatibility

This tool is designed to be compatible with `.wfm` files from a wide range of modern Rigol oscilloscopes. It has been tested with files from the following series:
* DS1000Z (e.g., DS1054Z)
* MSO5000

If your oscilloscope model is not listed, it is still likely to work. Please open an issue to confirm compatibility and help us update this list.
