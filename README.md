üåê **Try it Live**: [**nezarati.github.io/waveform-viewer**](https://nezarati.github.io/waveform-viewer/index.html)

A powerful, self-contained HTML-based tool for viewing and analyzing binary waveform files (`.wfm`) from **Rigol and Tektronix oscilloscopes**. This viewer runs entirely in your web browser with zero installation, providing an immediate, cross-platform solution for engineers, students, and hobbyists.

It extends basic viewing with a rich set of features for in-depth analysis, professional-grade exporting, and easy annotation.

## Key Features

### üìÇ File Handling
* **Universal WFM Support**: Open `.wfm` files from both **Rigol** and **Tektronix** oscilloscopes.
* **Easy Loading**: Load files via the "Load" button or by **dragging and dropping** them onto the page.
* **Multi-File Support**: Load multiple files simultaneously, each managed in a separate **tab**.
* **Probe Attenuation**: For Rigol files, set a **scale multiplier** (e.g., 1000 for a 1000x probe) upon loading to ensure correct voltage readings.
* **File Information**: The sidebar displays the filename, total data points, and detailed header information.

### üìà Waveform Display & Interaction
* **Stacked or Overlapped Views**: Toggle between the default overlapped view and a **separate, stacked view** where each channel gets its own plot area for clear, uncluttered analysis.
* **Modern Chart Interaction**:
    * **Pan**:
        * Click and drag anywhere on the chart background to pan all channels **horizontally and vertically** together.
        * In separate view, drag a subplot to pan it **vertically independently**.
        * Click and drag a specific waveform trace to adjust its vertical offset.
    * **Axis-Specific Zoom**: Hover your mouse over an axis and use the **Mouse Wheel** to zoom that axis independently. Works for the time (bottom) axis and for each individual channel's voltage (left) axis.
    * **Snap to Common Scales**: An optional mode that provides a reliable, stepped zoom experience through standard `1-2-5` scale values (e.g., 1ms, 2ms, 5ms).
    * **Area Zoom**: Press the `Z` key to activate zoom mode, then click and drag to select and zoom into a specific region.
* **View Controls**:
    * **Fit & Reset View**:
        * Press `F` to **Fit Y-Axis**. If the mouse is over a specific axis or subplot, only that channel is fitted. Otherwise, all visible channels are fitted to the data currently in view.
        * **Double-Click** the plot to perform a **Full Reset**, fitting all visible data on both axes.
    * **Relative Time**: Set the start of the current view as $t=0$ for relative time measurements.
* **Channel Management**:
    * Toggle channel visibility.
    * Swap the drawing order (bring a channel to the front).
    * Assign custom names to each channel.

### üìè Measurements & Analysis
* **Live Measurement Table**: An on-screen table displays key statistics for the *visible* portion of each waveform.
    * **Available Calculations**: **Max**, **Min**, **Average**, and **RMS** voltage.
    * **Customizable**: Toggle which measurements are displayed.
* **Cursor Measurements**:
    * Enable two horizontal and two vertical cursors for precise readouts.
    * Measures **$\Delta V$** (voltage difference), **$\Delta t$** (time difference), and frequency ($1/\Delta t$).
    * **Channel Tracking**: Cursors can "snap" to a selected channel's waveform.
    * **Quick Set**: Instantly move cursors to the max/min voltage points in the current view.

***

### ‚úíÔ∏è Annotations
* **Selectable Measurement Scale**: Choose which channel's vertical scale to use for all `ŒîV` measurements.
    * **Toolbar Control**: Select the active channel using the **"Measure Using: Ch1, Ch2..."** buttons in the top toolbar.
    * **Keyboard Shortcut**: Instantly switch between channels by pressing the `1`, `2`, `3`, or `4` keys.
* **Quick Measurement / Area Annotation**: Hold `Shift` + `Drag` to draw a measurement box showing `Œît`, `ŒîV`, and frequency ($1/\Delta t$). The box is colored based on the selected measurement channel. If **Annotate Mode** is active, the box becomes a persistent annotation upon release.
* **Text Annotation**: Press `T` to enter text mode and click on the plot to add labels.
* **Manage Annotations**:
    * Select annotations to move them.
    * Press `Delete` to remove a selected annotation.
    * Press `Ctrl` + `H` to hide or show all annotations on the chart.

***

### üì§ Exporting & Copying
* **Quick Copy**: Press `Ctrl` + `C` to copy the current view to the clipboard as a PNG image. A **"B&W Copy"** option is available for high-contrast pastes.
* **Advanced Export Dialog**: Generate professional-grade output for reports or data processing.
    * **Formats**: **PNG**, **SVG** (vector), and **CSV** (raw data).
    * **Data Scope**: Export either the current zoomed-in view or the entire waveform dataset.
    * **Styling Options**:
        * **Black & White**: Creates a high-contrast, printer-friendly version.
        * **IEEE Style**: Formats the plot for academic publications (specific size, `10pt Times New Roman` font, simplified colors).
        * **Measurements Below Plot**: Option to place the measurement table neatly at the bottom.

## Technical Details

This viewer is intentionally designed as a single, self-contained `index.html` file for maximum portability and simplicity. There are no external dependencies, no build steps, and no installation required.

* **Core Technology**: The application is built with vanilla **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **JavaScript (ES6+)**.
* **Rendering Engine**: All waveform plotting, grids, and annotations are rendered on the **HTML5 Canvas API**, providing high-performance graphics directly in the browser.
* **Binary File Parsing**: The viewer includes custom-built parsers for the Rigol and Tektronix `.wfm` formats. It uses the `FileReader` API to load files into an `ArrayBuffer` and then directly manipulates the binary data using `DataView` to extract waveform points and metadata according to the manufacturers' file specifications.
* **State Management**: The application state (view offsets, zoom levels, cursor positions, annotations, etc.) is managed in a simple JavaScript object. For multi-file support, an array of these state objects is maintained, with each tab corresponding to an element in the array.

## How to Use

1.  **Download**: Save the `index.html` file from this repository to your computer.
2.  **Open**: Open the file in a modern web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
3.  **Load**: Drag a `.wfm` file onto the page or use the "Load WFM File" button.

***

## Compatibility

This tool is designed to be compatible with `.wfm` files from a wide range of modern Rigol and Tektronix oscilloscopes. It has been tested with files from the following series:

* **Rigol**:
    * DS1000Z (e.g., DS1054Z)
    * MSO5000
* **Tektronix**:
    * Various series using the standard 16-bit integer `.wfm` format.

If your oscilloscope model is not listed, it is still likely to work. Please open an issue to confirm compatibility and help us update this list.
